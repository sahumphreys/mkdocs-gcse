In this section we'll be looking at the principles and concepts of programming *in general*.  There is a very full section on [Programming with Python](../python/index.md) which focuses on the syntax of the Python programming language and how that language can be used to solve problems programmatically.  The material covered here will/should be applicable to all other procedural programming languages.

All examples and code snippets will be expressed using **pseudocode** rather than Python and most of these fundamental concepts will be covered here by was of revision except where Python may do things a little differently, but there will, inevitably be some repetition.  Studying this material in association with that of the Python topic is advised.

Each of the exam boards express their algorithm using their own version of pseudocode, and this topic explores the difference between them.

In addition to the syntax and concepts we will also consider some good habits to develop when programming, including:

- Designing robust programs
- Dealing with errors
- Aspects of Integrated Development Environments
- Process of compilation and interpreters
