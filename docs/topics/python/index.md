## Overview

Whether you're new to coding or looking to enhance your skills, these pages will help you understand the fundamental concepts of programming in an easy-to-follow manner. 

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for beginners and students for GCSE level, and beyond.

In this tutorial series, we'll start with the basics, including [installing Python on your own computers](02_getting_started.md), understanding [variables](03_variables.md), data types, and control structures. You'll learn how to create [loops](09_iteration.md), make [decisions](08_selection.md) in your code with conditional statements, and handle data with [lists](11_lists.md) and [dictionaries](13_dictionaries.md). By the end of this course, you'll even be able to [read from and write to files](16_files.md), giving you the skills to manage data effectively. 

You may be examined on any of the content here in the final exams.  

The key to success with this topic is practice, practice, practice!  The more programming you do the more fluent you will become.  It can be hard at first but persevere, programming really is fun!

You may have had some experience with programming using Scratch.  If so you may find it useful to download and keep this comparison guide to Scratch and Python from [The Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org).
