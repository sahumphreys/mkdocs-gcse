Can you write the program that will help our scientists and engineers tackle the growing threat of climate change?

During the Programming with Python topic we'll gradually build a project that includes the concepts covered in the course building week-by-week into a fully functioning application.  Each week a new stage will be added building on the previous.

The outline scenario is:

### Title: **Climate Quest**

The player embarks on a journey to combat the effects of climate change by making decisions that impact the environment. Each choice affects the outcome of the game, emphasizing the importance of individual actions in addressing climate change.

#### Game Outline:

1. **Introduction:**

      - The game starts with an introduction explaining the current state of the environment (e.g., rising temperatures, melting ice caps, natural disasters).
      - The player's mission is to make choices that help mitigate these effects and protect the planet.

2. **Locations:**
   
      - The game can be divided into different locations representing various environmental settings:
        - Forest
        - Ocean
        - City
        - Arctic
        - Desert

3. **Challenges:**

      - At each location, the player faces challenges related to climate change, such as:
        - Deforestation
        - Pollution
        - Coral bleaching
        - Melting glaciers
        - Drought

4. **Decisions and Consequences:**

      - The player must make decisions at each stage that impact the environment and the overall progress of the game.
      - Positive decisions (e.g., recycling, planting trees) lead to a healthier environment and better outcomes.
      - Negative decisions (e.g., littering, using fossil fuels) worsen environmental conditions and make the game more challenging.

5. **Resources:**

      - The player can collect resources like:
        - Solar panels
        - Recycling bins
        - Reusable water bottles
        - Electric vehicles

6. **Final Challenge:**

      - The game culminates in a final challenge where the player must address a major environmental crisis and make critical decisions to save the planet.

7. **Endings:**

      - The game can have multiple endings based on the player's choices throughout the journey, showcasing the impact of individual actions on the environment.
