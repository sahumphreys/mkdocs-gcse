This is a big unit with many sections but reduces to the fact that computers are digital machines and all the data they process have to be converted from their original form, characters, sound, images etc., into a digital representation i.e. binary.  It's fundamental to our understanding of how computers work.

The unit starts with set theory (which is assessed in Paper 1 but also crops up in other topics such as regular expressions and databases) then proceeds to the fundamentals of the binary number system.  Then we look at how the binary number system is used for all types of data including numeric, textual, sound and graphics.  This topic is at the heart of everything you study in computer science, so it's pretty important to grasp these principles!

You will need to understand how and why numbers can be represented in different bases, including base 10 (decimal), base 2 (binary) and base 16 (hexadecimal)

You must be able to:

- convert numbers between these bases.
- add and multiply unsigned binary integers.
- subtract binary integers using two's complement

You must know that:

- the bit is the fundamental unit of information
- a byte is a group of 8 bits.

You need to know and understand how computer systems represent:

- integers: positive and negative (using two's complement)
- fixed-point fractions
- characters: ASCII and Unicode
- graphics: bitmap and vector
- sound: sampling and MIDI

You must also understand:

- how parity checks, majority voting, checksums and check digits can be used to detect and correct errors
- how and why data can be compressed

There is a lot of theory but grasping these fundamentals is important as it connects to all other topics in teh specification.
