In this topic, we will explore the foundational concepts of **relational databases** and learn how to manage them using **SQL (Structured Query Language)**. Relational databases are powerful systems used to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of structured data. In particular, we will focus on how data is stored in **tables**, with each table consisting of rows (records) and columns (fields). Key concepts such as **primary keys** and **foreign keys** will be introduced to explain how tables are related to one another, allowing for more efficient and organized data management. This understanding is essential for working with real-world data in a structured, meaningful way.

A major focus of the topic will be learning how to use **SQL commands** to interact with a relational database. We will practice 

- retrieving data using commands like `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE`, which allow users to extract specific information from one or more tables. 
- how to **sort data** using `ORDER BY`, 
- insert new records with `INSERT INTO`, and 
- modify or delete existing records using `UPDATE` and `DELETE`. 
  
By mastering these commands, we will gain the ability to manipulate data stored in relational databases, which is a critical skill in many areas of computer science and data management.

This knowledge is important because relational databases and SQL are used in countless industries, from finance to healthcare to social media platforms. As data plays an increasingly important role in decision-making and technology development, having a strong foundation in database management will give us the tools to handle and analyze data efficiently. 

Whether working on a small project or managing large datasets in a professional environment, understanding how to use relational databases and SQL is a valuable, practical skill.
